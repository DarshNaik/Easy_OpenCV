# Easy_OpenCV
Easy openCV projects


### Counting objects
run this code to count number of tetris objects in tetris_blocks.png image
    
##### Day 1 (1/11/18) :
* *Picking up where i left of in learning computer vision i.e Day (3/17) in pyimagesearch course*
* *Document scanner for static images added*

#### Day 2 (2/11/18) :
*   *making an object tracker for a green color ball i.e Day (4-5/17) in pyimagesearch course*

#### Day 3 (3/11/18) :
*   *fixing some bugs in the previous programs built*
*   *Finding ways for designing cross-platform appplications of computer vision*

#### Day 4 (4/11/18) :
*   *reading articles on android apps using openCV applications*

#### Day 5 (5/11/18) :
*   *searching different types of frame processing techniques for videostream*
*   *trying out the diferent functions in imutils module*

#### Day 6 (6/11/18) :
*   *updating on Day (5/17) in pyimagesearch course*
*   *seeing the difference of applications in opencv written in C++ and Python*

#### Day 7 (7/11/18) :
*   *completing Day (6/17) in pyimagesearch course*
*   *opencv program to get actual size of objects*

#### Day 8 (8/11/18) :
*   *reading articles on the recent topics in OpenCV*

#### Day 9 (9/11/18) :
*   *further reading on OpenCV applications*

#### Day 10 (10/11/18) :
*   *searching topics for a project without using machine learning techniques*

#### Day 11 (11/11/18) :
*   *going a little further in opencv (still not reached state where i can combine computer vision with machine learning)*

#### Day 12 

*taking a short break coz exams going on at my univ*

### Goal : *fully completing the intel's student kit on CV, Tensor Flow and Deep Learning*
